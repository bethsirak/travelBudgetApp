## Feedback and Future Improvements

I found this project to be a great learning experience while working with React and managing budgets and expenses. Some future improvements that I have in mind for the Budget App are:

- Enhancing the user interface with more intuitive styling and visual feedback.
- Adding user authentication to allow multiple users to have their separate budgets and expenses.
- Implementing data persistence to store budget and expense data even after the user
